# Summary

Renewable energy sources are likely to build the backbone of the future global energy system.
One important key to a successful energy transition is to analyse the weather-dependent energy outputs 
of existing and eligible renewable resources.
`atlite` is an open Python software package for retrieving global historical weather data and converting it to power generation potentials and time series 
for renewable energy technologies like wind turbines or solar photovoltaic panels based on detailed mathematical models.
It further provides weather-dependent output on the demand side like building heating demand and heat pump performance.
The software is optimized to aggregate data over multiple large regions with user-defined weightings based on land use or energy yield.



# Statement of need


Deriving weather-based time series and maximum capacity potentials for renewables over large regions is a common problem in energy system modelling.
Websites with exposed open APIs such as [renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja) [@pfenninger_long-term_2016; @staffell_using_2016] exist for such purpose but are difficult to use for local execution, e.g. in cluster environments, and restricted to non-commercial use.
Further, by design, they neither expose the underlying datasets nor methods for deriving time series, here referred to as conversion functions/methods.
This makes them unsuited for utilizing different weather datasets or exploring alternative conversion functions.
The [pvlib](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) [@holmgren_pvlib_2018] is suited for local execution and allows interchangeable input data but is specialized to PV systems only and intended for single location modelling.
Other packages like the Danish REatlas [@andresen_validation_2015] face obstacles with accessibility, are based on proprietary code, miss documentation and are restricted in flexibility regarding their inputs.


The purpose of `atlite` is to fill this gap and provide an open, community-driven library. `atlite` was initially built as a lightweight alternative to REatlas and has evolved further to contain multiple additional features.
`atlite` is designed with extensibility in mind for new renewable technologies and conversion methods.
An abstraction layer for weather datasets enables interchangability of the underlying datasets.
By leveraging the Python packages [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) [@hoyer_xarray_2017],
[dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) [@dask_development_team_dask_2016] and [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [@gillies_2019], 
`atlite` makes use of parallelization and memory efficient backends thus performing well even on large datasets.


# Basic Concept


The starting point of most `atlite` functionalities is the `atlite.Cutout` class. It serves as a container for a spatio-temporal subset of one or more topology and weather datasets.
Since such datasets are typically global and span multiple decades, the Cutout class allows `atlite` to reduce the scope to a more manageable size.
As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cutout}, a typical workflow consists of three steps: Cutout creation, Cutout preparation and Cutout conversion.

![A typical workflow in `atlite` consists of the three steps: 1. Cutout creation, 2. Preparation, 3. Conversion. \label{fig:cutout}](figures/workflow.png)


## Cutout Creation and Preparation


The Cutout creation requires specifications of the geographical and temporal bounds, the path of the associated `netcdf` file to be created
and the data source referred to as *module*. Optionally, the temporal and spatial resolution may be adjusted. The default is set to 1 hour and 0.25$^\circ$ latitude times 0.25$^\circ$ longitude. So far, `atlite` supports three different *modules*:

1. [ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5)](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) provides various weather-related variables in an hourly resolution from 1950 onward on a spatial grid with a 0.25$^\circ$ x 0.25$^\circ$ resolution, most of which is reanalysis data. `atlite` automatically retrieves the raw data using the [Climate Data Store (CDS) API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) after the initial set up by the user. When the requested data points diverge from the original grid, the API retrieves interpolated values based on the original grid data.

2. [Heliosat (SARAH-2)](https://wui.cmsaf.eu/safira/action/viewDoiDetails?acronym=SARAH_V002) provides satellite-based solar data in a 30 min resolution from 1983 to 2015 on a spatial grid ranging from -65$^\circ$ to +65$^\circ$ longitude/latitude with a resolution of 0.05$^\circ$ x 0.05$^\circ$. In case of a diverging Cutout grid, a resampling function provided by `atlite` projects the data accordingly. The full dataset cannot be automatically retrieved and must be downloaded by the user beforehand.

3. [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/) is a bathymetric dataset covering terrain heights on a 15 arc-second resolved spatial grid. Using an averaging resampling method, the data is projected to the Cutout resolution. The full dataset cannot be automatically retrieved and must be downloaded by the user beforehand.

Creating a Cutout triggers the program to initialize the grid cells and the coordinate system on which the data will lay. As indicated in Figure \ref{fig:cutout}, the shapes of the grid cells are created such that their coordinates are centered in the middle. As soon as the Cutout preparation is executed, `atlite` retrieves/loads data variables, adds them to the Cutout and finally stores the Cutout in a `netcdf` file. 
`atlite` groups weather variables into *features*, which can be used as front-end keys for preparing a subset of the available weather variables. The following table shows the variable groups for all datasets.

+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
|   feature     |         ERA5                     |        SARAH-2          | GEBCO              |
|               |         variables                |        variables        | variables          |
+===============+==================================+=========================+====================+

|               | influx\_diffuse, albedo          | influx\_diffuse         |                    |
+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
| temperature   | temperature, soil\_temperature   |                         |                    |
+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
| runoff        | runoff                           |                         |                    |
+---------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+


A Cutout may combine features from different sources, e.g. 'height' from GEBCO and 'runoff' from ERA5. Future versions of atlite will likely introduce the possibility to retrieve explicit weather variables from the CDS API. Further, the climate projection dataset [CORDEX](https://rcmes.jpl.nasa.gov/content/cordex), for which support was dropped with the latest release `v0.2` due to compatibility issues, is likely to be reintroduced.


## Conversion Functions


`atlite` currently offers conversion functions for deriving time series and static potentials from Cutouts for the following types of renewables:

* **Solar photovoltaic** --
Two alternative solar panel models are provided based on @huld_mapping_2010 and @beyer_robust_2004, both of which
use the clear sky model from @reindl_diffuse_1990 and a
solar azimuth and altitude position tracking based on @kalogirou_solar_2009, @michalsky_astronomical_1988
and @sproul_derivation_2007 combined with a surface orientation algorithm following @sproul_derivation_2007.
Optionally, optimal latitude heuristics from @charles_r_landau_optimum_2017 are supported.

* **Solar thermal collector** --
Low-temperature heat for space or district heating is implemented based on the formulation in @henning_comprehensive_2014, which combines average global radiation with storage losses dependent on the current outside temperature.

* **Wind turbine** -- 
The wind turbine power output is calculated from down-scaled wind speeds at hub height using either a custom power curve, one of 16 predefined wind turbine configurations, or any of those listed in the [OEP Wind Turbine Library](https://openenergy-platform.org/dataedit/view/supply/wind_turbine_library). Optionally, convolution with a Gaussian kernel for region-specific calibration given real-world reference data as presented by @andresen_validation_2015 is supported.

* **Hydro run-off power** --
A heuristic approach uses surface run-off weather data (e.g. from rainfall or melting snow) which is normalized to match reported energy production figures by the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world).
The resulting time series are optionally weighted by the height of the run-off location and may be smoothed for a more realistic representation.

* **Hydro reservoir and dam power** --
Following @liu_validated_2019 and @lehner_global_2013, run-off data is aggregated to and collected in basins which are obtained and estimated in their size with the help of the [HydroSHEDS](https://hydrosheds.org/) dataset.

* **Heating demand** --
Space heating demand is obtained with a simple degree-day approximation where
the difference between outside ground-level temperature and a reference temperature scaled by a linear factor yields the desired estimate.



The conversion functions are highly flexible and allow the user to calculate different types of outputs, which arise from the set of input arguments. In energy system models, network nodes are often associated with geographical regions which serve as catchment areas for electric loads, renewable energy potentials and more. As indicated in the third step of Figure \ref{fig:cutout}, `atlite`'s conversion functions allow projecting renewable time series on a set of regions. Therefore, `atlite` internally computes the Indicator Matrix $\textbf{I}$ with values $I_{r,x,y}$ representing the per-unit overlap between region $r$ and the grid cell at $(x,y)$. Then, the resulting time series $\varphi_r(t)$ for region $r$ is given by 

$$\varphi_r(t) = \sum_{x,y} I_{r,x,y} \, \varphi_{x,y}(t),$$ 


where $\varphi_{x,y}(t)$ is the converted time series of grid cell $(x,y)$. Further, the user may define custom weightings $\lambda_{x,y}$ of the grid cells, referred to as layout, representing, for instance, the spatial distribution of installed capacities within a region, which modifies the above equation to 

$$\varphi_r(t) = \sum_{x,y} I_{r,x,y} \, \lambda_{x,y} \, \varphi_{x,y}(t).$$

The conversion functions may optionally return the per-unit time series $\tilde{\varphi}_r(t) = \varphi_r(t) / c_r$ where $c_r$ is the installed capacity per region given by 

$$c_r = \sum_{x,y} I_{r,x,y} \, \lambda_{x,y},$$ 

which may be returned as an output as well.


## Land-Use Restrictions

Land-use restrictions limit the deployment of renewables infrastructure.
Wind turbines, for example, may only be placed in eligible places which have to fulfill general and country-specific requirements,
e.g. being outside of protected areas or at a sufficient distance to residential areas.

`atlite` provides a performant, parallelized implementation to calculate land-use availabilities within all grid cells of a Cutout. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:land-use}, the entries $A_{r,x,y}$ of an Availability Matrix $\textbf{A}$ indicate the overlap of the eligible area of region $r$ with grid cell at $(x,y)$. Note that this is analogous to the Indicator Matrix $\textbf{I}$ but with reduced area. The user can exclude geometric shapes or geographic rasters of arbitrary projection, like specific codes of the [Corine Land Cover (CLC)](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover) database.
To determine capacity expansion potentials per region, `atlite` does not use an explicit placement algorithm (e.g. for wind turbines), but the product of available area and allowed deployment density.
The implementation is inspired by the [GLAES](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/glaes) [@ryberg_evaluating_2018]
software package, which itself is no longer maintained and incompatible with newer versions of the underlying [GDAL](https://gdal.org/index.html) software.

# Related Research 

`atlite` is used by several research projects and groups. The [PyPSA-Eur workflow](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) [@horsch_pypsa-eur_2018] is an open model dataset of the European power system which exploits the full potential of `atlite`  including Cutout preparation and conversion to wind, solar and hydro reservoir time series with restricted land-use availabilities. The sector-coupled extension [PyPSA-Eur-sec](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec) [@brown_synergies_2018] calculates heat-demand profiles as well as heat pump coefficients with `atlite`. The [Euro Calliope](https://github.com/calliope-project/euro-calliope) studied in @trondle_trade-offs_2020 uses `atlite` to generate hydroelectricity time series from reservoirs. The interactive tool [model.energy](https://model.energy) also employs the `atlite` libary.
